Suitsupply iOS 
==============

Assessment to test future iOS developers. 

We hope you had as much fun as we do coding and pushing yourself with new challenges.

## Introduction

In order to evaluate your skills and coding style we would like you to develop a small iOS application that consumes [Best Buy](https://developer.bestbuy.com/) API RESTFull services.

## Application

We would like to have an small application that accomplishes the following.

1. The main screen will have a search text input where the user can search for any BestBuy product (e.g Mobile Devices as iPhones, HTCs, Samsung...) within any category or a category you prefer, once search button on the keyboard or a search button on the screen it's been pressed, you need to search for those products and return step 2. 

2. Once the products are returned, then you will need to present them as a list with the following information.
	* Product Thumbnail.
	* Product Name.
	* Product Price.
	 
	When the user presses on any item within the list go to step 3.

3. The user should see the details of the product as follows:
	* Product Image, bigger than the Thumbnail.
	* Product Name.
	* Product Price.
	* If the product is on sale, should show sale price.
	* Number of reviews by the customers.
	* Review average.
	* Description.
	* Related products Button. If the user presses this button go to step 4.
	* Accessories Button. If the user presses this button go to step 5.

4. A list view with the related products for the item showed. Every product should show the following information.
	* Product Image.
	* Product Name.
	* Product Price.
	 
5. A grid list view with the accessories for the item shown. Every accessory should show the following information.
	* Product Image.
	* Product Price.
